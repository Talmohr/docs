## What is TestFairy?
TestFairy is a mobile testing platform that enables teams to find, report and solve complex problems with their mobile apps, all from one dashboard. The platform includes an enterprise app-distribution solution for iOS and Android apps, and an SDK that collects valuable information such as videos showing user behavior, app logs and crash reports. This information is collected and presented in an organized way, in a single, easy-to-use dashboard helping teams to quickly reproduce and understand problems, allowing for accurate and timely bug fixes.


We will help your team with:
   * **Distributing apps** to anyone who should be testing the app. This is done either via a direct email with a download link, or through our beautiful automatically generated landing pages, which include both a QR code or download link for either an iOS or Android version.
   
   * **Easily sending visual feedback and bug reports** directly from the app by shaking your device. A video recording, app logs and device metrics will automatically be attached to your report, and sent directly to your dev team. Integrate with your favorite team chat, continuous integration tool, bug tracking system and Single Sign On service to streamline the reporting process and get crucial information right where you need it.
   
   * **Priceless insights** Watch how people use your app and fully understand user behavior. View detailed app metrics such as CPU, memory, phone reception, and Wifi, and relive your user's detailed environment conditions to reproduce and fix bugs faster. Understand what happened BEFORE your app crashed or an issue was reported, without talking to your users!
