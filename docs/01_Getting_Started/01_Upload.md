## <a id="Uploading"></a> Uploading Your Application

Once your account is created and verified, you are ready to upload your app.

Uploading is just as simple as it sounds! Just click on the **Upload** button on the top-right side of the upper menu, and follow the on-screen instructions.

We recommend using our <a href="http://docs.testfairy.com/Upload_API.html">Upload API</a> to enable our <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/TestFairy+Plugin">Jenkins plugin</a>, <a href="#">Gradle plugin</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/testfairy/command-line-uploader" target="_blank">Command line uploader</a>. 

The code of our command line uploader, Jenkins and Gradle plugins is open source, so you can feel free to change and improve on it.

This guide will describe the manual upload process.


## Selecting Your Project Settings

You can define your testing settings right on the upload process.

**Selecting Your Project Settings**

Here are the parameters you can set up directly on the **Upload** page.
Additional settings can be configured from the <a href="http://docs.testfairy.com/Getting_Started/Account_Settings.html">Project Settings</a> page.

 * CPU 
 * Memory
 * Network
 * Application logcat
 * Phone signal (Android only)
 * Battery (Android only)
 * WIFI (Android only)
 * Network HTTP request (iOS only)

In addition, you can set the following parameters:

-- **Auto-Update** - When auto update is enabled, users using previous versions of this app will get a notification about the new version next time they open up the app. The new version will be downloaded automatically, so the user doesn't have to actively download it. Please note that in this case no email notification will be sent to the testers.

-- **Custom Comments** - Use this section to add release notes, describe the updated/changes and write about anything else you would like your testers to be aware of.

## <a id="Uploading"></a> Updating an app

If you wish to update an app, all you have to do is simply upload it again, the same app with the same version. The new file will override the old file.

## <a id="Uploading"></a> Uploading a new version

If you wish to upload a new version of the same app, all you have to do is upload the new version the exact same way you've uploaded the old version. Our service will identify that both apps have the same package name (budle id) and group them together in the same project.
